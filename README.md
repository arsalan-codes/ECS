# Environmental Control System (ECS)

The **Environmental Control System (ECS)** is a smart application designed to monitor and optimize the environmental conditions within a specified area. It provides real-time data on temperature, humidity, and oxygen levels, helping ensure an optimal atmosphere for various environments such as laboratories, greenhouses, or data centers.

## Features

- **Real-Time Environmental Data Monitoring**
  - **Temperature**: Tracks the average temperature in the environment (currently set to 24Â°C).
  - **Humidity**: Monitors the average humidity levels (currently set to 63%).
  - **Oxygen Levels**: Provides information on the oxygen concentration (currently 93%).

- **Fan and Lighting Control**
  - Automatically adjusts the fans and lighting based on environmental data to maintain ideal conditions.

- **AI-Powered Optimization**
  - Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze environmental data and optimize settings for energy efficiency and performance.

- **Camera Monitoring**
  - Provides live camera feed for remote monitoring of the environment.

- **Historical Data Visualization**
  - View and analyze historical environmental data through interactive graphs and charts to track trends over time.
